# GAE3
Tests for two samples:
  
  1. Copy your Quarto (.qmd), references.bib, and data file (.csv) from GAE2 into the GAE3 project folder.
  2. Edit the Quarto document to reflect the different intent of this project.
  3. Use an appropriate test to test the null hypothesis of equal lengths for red and white beans.
  4. Report your results.
